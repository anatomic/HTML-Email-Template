# HTML Email Template

## Images

While developing an email all image should be stored in the `img/` folder, this allows the debug css to check whether or not you are running your images locally.  Eventually you'll need to setup some hosting for your images so once you've finalised the images/structure for an email I'd suggest you put them on a server and work with them remotely.
